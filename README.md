Assignment 1 
--------------------

Task 1      Functionality Description: 
------------------------------------------

1.  Taking Input:

Take two numbers as input from the user

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers. The input() function is used to take the input from the user, and int() is used to convert the input to an integer.

2.   Performing Mathematical Operations:

Addition: 
The program adds the two numbers using the + operator and stores the result in the addition variable.

Subtraction: 
The program subtracts the second number from the first number using the - operator and stores the result in the subtraction variable.

Multiplication: 
The program multiplies the two numbers using the * operator and stores the result in the multiplication variable.

Division: The program divides the first number by the second number using the / operator and stores the result in the division variable.


3.  Displaying the Results:

The program prints the results of each operation using the print() function. The results are displayed in a straightforward manner, showing the operation name followed by the result.



Task 2      Functionality Description:
-------------------------------------------

Input:  Takes first and last names from the user.
Concatenation:  Joins them into a full name.
Output:  Displays a greeting using the full name.



Assignment 2 
-------------------------


Task 1    
---------------

1.  Input: The program uses the input function to get a number from the user and converts it to an integer using int().

2.  Check: The program uses an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd. The condition number % 2 == 0 checks if the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is 0.

    *  If the condition is true, the number is even.
    *  If the condition is false, the number is odd.

3.  Output: The program prints the result using the print function.




Task 2     
----------------

1.   Initialization: The variable total_sum is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the running total of the numbers.

2.  Loop: The for loop iterates through each number from 1 to 50. For each number, it adds the number to total_sum.

3.  Output: After the loop finishes, the program prints the final sum.
